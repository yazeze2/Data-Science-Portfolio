## Data Science Projects

- [Deep-Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yazeze2/Deep-Learning) - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Models for twitter sentiment analysis - without using NLTK's built-in sentiment analysis engine
- [Supervised Learning: SVM, Decision Tree & AdaBoost - Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/yazeze2/Finding-Donors-for-CharityML) - In this project, the performance of the various supervised algorithms are tested to accurately model an individuals' income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census
- [Time Series Analysis - Predict Traffic on a New Mode of Transport](https://github.com/yazeze2/Time-Series) - In this project, the Holt's Linear Trend Model, Holt Winter's Model, ARIMA Model, and SARIMA Model are implemented and contrasted to predict traffic.
- [Supervised Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yazeze2/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using Supervised Learning Algorithms (without using NLTK's built-in sentiment analysis engine)
- [Unsupervised Learning: Gaussian Mixture Model - Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/yazeze2/Customer-Segmentation) - In this project I analyzed a wholesale customers dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) in diverse product categories for customer segmentation
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yazeze2/Text_Mining) - In this project, twitter scraping is performed to gather data and tweet Sentiment Analysis is implemented using Naive Bayes Classifier. Moreover, Topic Modelling is implemented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- [Object Tracking in video Using Kalman Filter](https://github.com/yazeze2/Object-Tracking-Using-Kalman-Filter) - Object Detection and Tracking using Kalman Filter
- [911 Call Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/yazeze2/911-Exploratory-Analysis-Project) - This project is strictly completed to implement Exploratory Analysis on 911 call dataset. It is done to demonstrate the extraction of meaningful features by playing with the different variables in the dataset.

## Mini Data Science Projects

Data science projects completed by me for academic, purposes using Python and MATLAB. All the projects listed here are completed without the use of any pre-built machine learning Libraries

- [Multilayer Perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Multilayer-PTA-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Recognition) - Multilayer perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification on MNIST dataset
- [Neural Networks Backpropagation for Siusodial Curve fitting](https://github.com/yazeze2/Curve-Fitting_Backpropagation_python) - In this project the backpropagation algorithm was used to fit a given sinusoidal function
- [Support Vector Machines for non-linear data classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-) - The goal of this project was to classify two non-linear classes in which the data points for one class are bounded within a Moon and Mountain  shaped boundaries while the data points for the other class rest outside of these boundaries.
