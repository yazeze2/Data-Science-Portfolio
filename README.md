## Data Science Projects

- [Deep-Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yazeze2/Deep-Learning) - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Models for twitter sentiment analysis - without using NLTK's in-built sentiment analysis engine
- [Supervised Learning: SVM, Decision Tree & AdaBoost - Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/yazeze2/Finding-Donors-for-CharityML) - In this project, the performance of the various supervised algorithms are tested to accurately model an individuals' income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census
- [Time Series Analysis - Predict Traffic on a New Mode of Transport](https://github.com/yazeze2/Time-Series) - In this project, the Holt's Linear Trend Model, Holt Winter's Model, ARIMA Model, and SARIMA Model are implemented and contrasted to predict traffic.
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yazeze2/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using Supervised Learning Algorithms (without using NLTK's in-built sentiment analysis engine)
- [Unsupervised Learning: Gaussian Mixture Model - Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/yazeze2/Customer-Segmentation) - In this project I analyzed a wholesale customers dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) in diverse product categories for customer segmentation
- [Text Mining](https://github.com/yazeze2/Text_Mining) - In this project, twitter scraping is performed to gather data and perform tweet Sentiment Analysis, using Naive Bayes Classifier, and Topic Modelling, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- [Object Tracking in video Using Kalman Filter](https://github.com/yazeze2/Object-Tracking-Using-Kalman-Filter) - Object Detection and Tracking using Kalman Filter
- [911 Call Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/yazeze2/911-Exploratory-Analysis-Project) - This project is implemented to demonstrate extraction of useful features from different variables

## Mini Machine Learning Projects

Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, purposes using Python and MATLAB. All the projects listed here are completed without the use of any pre-built machine learning Libraries

- [Multilayer Perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Multilayer-PTA-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Recognition) - Multilayer perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification on MNIST dataset
- [Neural Networks Backpropagation for Siusodial Curve fitting](https://github.com/yazeze2/Curve-Fitting_Backpropagation_python) - In this project the backpropagation algorithm was used to fit a given sinusoidal function
- [Support Vector Machines for non-linear data classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-) - The goal of this project was to classify two non-linear classes in which the data points for one class are bounded within a Moon and Mountain  shaped boundaries while the data points for the other class rest outside of these boundaries.
